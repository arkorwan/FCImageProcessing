cocoa-imageprocessing
=====================
FCImageConverter has its implementation copied from OpenCV tutorial page: http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/tutorials/ios/image_manipulation/image_manipulation.html

FCTextBinarizer is originally ported from python version here: https://github.com/jasonlfunk/ocr-text-extraction
Some modifications are made but it's mostly just me playing around with the threshold numbers.
